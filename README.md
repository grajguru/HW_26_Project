# Angular Distribution of Radiation and Synchrotron Emission

This Jupyter notebook illustrates the Angular Distribution of Radiation and Synchrotron Emission, as part of Radiative Processes class in Clemson University: Department of Physics and Astronomy. You can run the notebook on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) by clicking on the Open in Colab badge at the end of this paragraph.  You will need to sign in with your Google account.  Execute the whole notebook by clicking on Run all from the Runtime menu (you will click on Run anyway if an authorship warning appears).  You can then change inputs or code in the notebook, as desired.

Alternatively, you can run on your local computer.  To do so, once you have installed [the Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), download the linked notebook above (right-click or control-click).  To run the notebook from the command line, type, for example,

**jupyter notebook notebook_template.ipynb**

Be sure to remove any suffix that is not *.ipynb* on the notebook file you download.  For example, some browsers will by default add a *.txt* to the downloaded file so that it has suffix *.ipynb.txt*.  Remove the *.txt* before running.
